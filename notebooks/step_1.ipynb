    "## Step 1 Completion Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Implemented Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PDF Text Extraction**: Successfully extracted and cleaned text from Meta's Q1 2024 financial report\n",
    "2. **Text Chunking**: Created semantic chunks with sentence-based boundaries for better context preservation\n",
    "3. **Embedding Generation**: Used `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer for generating document embeddings\n",
    "4. **Vector Storage**: Implemented FAISS-based vector store for efficient similarity search\n",
    "5. **Retrieval System**: Cosine similarity-based retrieval returning top-3 most relevant chunks\n",
    "6. **Answer Generation**: Template-based answer generation with context extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Test Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Test Queries:**\n",
    "- ✅ \"What was Meta's revenue in Q1 2024?\" - Successfully retrieved relevant financial data\n",
    "- ✅ \"What were the key financial highlights for Meta in Q1 2024?\" - Retrieved comprehensive overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Technical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embedding Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dimensional embeddings)\n",
    "- **Chunking Strategy**: Semantic chunking with 4 sentences per chunk for better context\n",
    "- **Similarity Metric**: Cosine similarity with L2 normalization\n",
    "- **Vector Database**: FAISS IndexFlatIP for efficient nearest neighbor search\n",
    "- **Generation Method**: Template-based with pattern matching for financial terms\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Chunks**: Variable based on document size\n",
    "- **Embedding Dimension**: 384D\n",
    "- **Average Similarity Score**: Measured across test queries\n",
    "- **Retrieval Accuracy**: Context-relevant chunks successfully retrieved\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps for Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhanced Generation**: Integrate more sophisticated LLM for better answer generation\n",
    "2. **Query Expansion**: Add query preprocessing and expansion techniques\n",
    "3. **Multi-document Support**: Extend to handle multiple financial reports\n",
    "4. **Advanced Chunking**: Implement document-aware chunking strategies\n",
    "5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Add quantitative evaluation methods (BLEU, ROUGE, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic RAG pipeline is now functional and ready for the required test queries!"
