# Financial Data RAG Pipeline - Project Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the development and implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed specifically for financial document question-answering. The system successfully processes Meta's Q1 2024 financial report to answer targeted queries about revenue, financial highlights, and other key metrics.

## Project Overview

### Objective
Build a robust RAG pipeline capable of:
- Extracting and processing financial PDF documents
- Generating semantic embeddings for efficient information retrieval
- Providing accurate answers to financial queries using retrieved context

### Test Queries
The system was designed to answer two primary queries:
1. "What was Meta's revenue in Q1 2024?"
2. "What were the key financial highlights for Meta in Q1 2024?"

## Technical Approach and Rationale

### 1. Document Processing Strategy
**Approach**: Multi-stage text extraction and cleaning pipeline
- **PDF Extraction**: Used PyPDF2 for reliable text extraction from financial PDFs
- **Text Cleaning**: Implemented regex-based preprocessing to handle financial symbols, special characters, and PDF artifacts
- **Rationale**: Financial documents contain specific formatting and symbols that require specialized preprocessing

### 2. Text Chunking Strategy
**Approach**: Semantic sentence-based chunking with NLTK fallback
- **Primary Method**: NLTK sentence tokenization for natural language boundaries
- **Fallback**: Regex-based sentence splitting for robustness
- **Chunk Size**: 4 sentences per chunk for optimal context preservation
- **Rationale**: Sentence-based chunks maintain semantic coherence better than fixed-size word chunks, crucial for financial context

### 3. Embedding Generation
**Approach**: Sentence Transformers with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
- **Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dimensional embeddings)
- **Advantages**: Lightweight, fast, good semantic representation
- **Processing**: Batch processing with L2 normalization for cosine similarity
- **Rationale**: Balanced performance between speed and quality, suitable for CPU environments

### 4. Vector Storage and Retrieval
**Approach**: FAISS-based similarity search
- **Index Type**: IndexFlatIP (Inner Product) for cosine similarity
- **Retrieval**: Top-k retrieval with configurable parameters
- **Rationale**: FAISS provides efficient similarity search with excellent performance scaling

### 5. Answer Generation
**Approach**: Generative LLM using FLAN-T5-small
- **Model**: Google's FLAN-T5-small for instruction-following
- **Method**: Prompt-based generation with context and question formatting
- **Rationale**: Lightweight generative model suitable for CPU deployment while maintaining answer quality
